# Deploy MeiliSearch through DigitalOcean Marketplace

## Create an out of the box MeiliSearch

### 1. Create a new droplet

In any DigitalOcean page, when you are logged in, you will find a menu in the upper-right corner. Click on Create -> Droplets

### 3. Click on show all plans

By default, Digital Ocean propose plans that might be too expensive for our testing purposes. If you want to select the cheapest plan for testing, click on "show all plans" (bottom-right corner) or the arrow pointing left.

### 5. Select a region for your droplet

Select the region where you want to deploy your droplet. Remember, closer is faster, but prices can change significantly. We will choose London for this example, but it works anywhere

### 6. Add your ssh key

Select your SSH key in order to be able to connect to your droplet later. If you don't see your SSH key add yours to your account.

### 8. Add tags

Tags are a very good method to know who created ressources, and for organizing or cleaning purposes. Try to always add some tags so other people can know who uses the machine, and for what purposes.

# Configure settings in your MeiliSearch Droplet

Configuring your MeiliSearch from a DigitalOcean droplet is very straigth-forward. Establish an SSH connection with your droplet and a script will guide you through the process.

### 12. Make your domain name point to your droplet

If you want to use your own domnain name (or sub-domain), add an A record in your domain name provider account

![img](../doc/img/12.domain-a-record.png "Domain to  MeiliSearch")  

This should work out of the box. Your domain should be usable for your MeiliSearch

### 13. Set API KEY and SSL (HTTPS)

Meilisearch is running unconfigured. It means that you haven't set up an API KEY (anyone can read/write from your MeiliSearch) and you can't use HTTPS. But no worries, the configuration process is automated and very simple. Just connect via SSH to your new MeiliSearch Droplet and answer a few questions:

### 13.1. Open a terminal

Open a terminal and start a new SSH connection with the IP you got from DigitalOcean  

Write in your terminal `ssh root@134.122.99.185`  and press Enter to establish connection 

![img](../doc/img/13.open-terminal-ssh.png "Terminal ssh")  

Write `yes` and press Enter to accept the authentication process  

![img](../doc/img/13.auth-yes.png "Auth")  

A script will run automatically, asking for your settings. If you want to run this script anytime, you can run it again by typing:  

`sh /var/opt/meilisearch/scripts/first-login/001-first-login.sh`

### 14. Enjoy your ready to use MeiliSearch 

Enjoy!
